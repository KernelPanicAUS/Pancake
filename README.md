## About Pancake
Pancake is a project created by [Rudy Rosciglione](https://github.com/RudyRosciglione). The story of the application is unique. Indeed Rudy didn’t have the whole development skills required to properly develop it. So instead of shutting down the project, he preferred to publish it on Github. There has been such an excitement generated by the application’s idea that several developers have made pull-requests to help with the development. Most recently, [Angel Vazquez](https://github.com/avazquezpr) has naturally offered to finish and fully develop the application. But the Application development files will stay public on [Github](https://github.com/RudyRosciglione/Pancake) because any help can come from anywhere in the world! 

Pancake will be free.
